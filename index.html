        In this example we're getting some CSS information from the
        [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) project, we're integrating a company
        style standard, an engineering style standard, a style motif for the launch of
        "Project X" and then we're adding some specific rules about font display. You
        can bring in a **lot** of information with the `<link>` tag!
         
        This specific example aside, you'll be learning a lot more about linking
        files to create stylistic effect in later lessons.
         
        ### `title`
         
        One more common tag we find in the `head` is `title`. The `title`, as its name
        implies, is where the title of the webpage should be entered. Text added inside
        the `title` tags will appear up on your browser tab. Adding a title for our
        `index.html` page would look something like:
         
        ```html
        <title>Cat Perry's Favorite Cats</title>
    </head>
  <body></body>
